# Responsive-Portfolio

## Overview: 
Enhance Portfolio project with a mobile-responsive layout.

## Technology 
* HTML
* CSS

## Comments
* Added three media queries for max-widths of 980px, 768px, and 640px 
* Incorporated animations for the form labels on the Contact Me page


## Challenges
* It took a lot of research to figure out how to add the media queries correctly since we barely covered it in class. 

## Feedback and Questions
* Please comment on the general code structure. Is there a more efficient way to achieve the same results? 
* I only used `max-width` property. Should I have added `min-width` as well?
* Should `portrait` and `landscape` be incorporated into media queries?
* Portfolio page - please provide feedback on how to make `h3` width match the image? I used a workaround.
